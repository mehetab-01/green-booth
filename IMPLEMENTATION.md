# Green Booth Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete web application has been implemented for the Green Booth project, allowing users to capture and share images related to greenery, social cleanliness, and green club events.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- **Google Sign-In Integration**: Uses Firebase Authentication
- **Secure user sessions**: Automatically manages authentication state
- **User profile display**: Shows user name and photo when signed in

### 2. Image Capture & Upload
- **Camera Capture**: 
  - Real-time camera access using react-webcam
  - Preview before upload
  - Captured images are stored as JPEG format
  
- **Image Upload**:
  - File picker for existing images
  - Image preview before submission
  - Supports all common image formats

### 3. Cloud Storage
- **Firebase Storage**: All images are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage
- **Organized structure**: Images stored in `images/{userId}/{timestamp}`
- **Metadata tracking**: Each image includes:
  - User ID
  - User email
  - User display name
  - Upload timestamp
  - Upload type (camera or upload)

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- **Accessible at `/admin`**
- **View all uploaded images** with user information
- **Statistics dashboard** showing:
  - Total images uploaded
  - Number of camera captures
  - Number of file uploads
- **Grid layout** with responsive design
- **Image metadata display** including uploader name, email, and timestamp

### 5. QR Code Access
- **Automatic QR code generation** for the application URL
- **Easy mobile access** - users can scan to access the booth
- **Displayed on landing page** before sign-in

### 6. Responsive UI
- **Modern green-themed design** matching the environmental focus
- **Mobile-first approach** with responsive layouts
- **Tailwind CSS styling** for consistent design
- **Loading states** and user feedback throughout

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

### Backend Services
- **Firebase Authentication** - Google OAuth
- **Firebase Storage** - Image storage
- **Firebase Firestore** - Metadata database

### Libraries

```

## Setup Requirements

1. **Firebase Project Setup**:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Enable Google Authentication
   - Enable Firebase Storage
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Configure security rules

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add Firebase configuration values
   - Set the application URL

3. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Recommended Firebase Rules

**Firestore Rules** (for image metadata):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /images/{imageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

**Storage Rules** (for image files):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /images/{userId}/{imageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                     request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Flow

1. **User visits the site** → Sees QR code and sign-in prompt
2. **User scans QR code** (optional) → Opens the application on mobile
3. **User signs in with Google** → Authenticated and redirected
4. **User chooses capture method**:
   - Opens camera → Takes photo → Reviews → Uploads
   - Selects file → Previews → Uploads
5. **Image is stored** in Firebase with metadata
6. **Admin visits `/admin`** → Views all uploaded images

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

- Image categorization/tagging
- Event-specific galleries
- Image moderation workflow
- Photo comments and reactions
- Download functionality for admins
- Image search and filtering
- User galleries (view own uploads)
- Social sharing features
- Achievement badges for active users
- Analytics dashboard

## Build & Deployment

The application:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Passes all linting checks
- ✅ Has proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Is production-ready

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any Next.js-compatible platform with environment variables configured.
